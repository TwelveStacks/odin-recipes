      Start with a bulking chili loaded with ground beef and beans, and then add
      pasta. That’s all there is to this dish, so you can start with your
      family’s favorite chili recipe, or use the easy one here.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 lb. 90% lean ground beef</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. flour</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. chili powder</li>
      <li>1 can (15 oz.) tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 can (15 oz.) diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 can (15 oz.) black beans</li>
      <li>1 can (15 oz.) kidney beans</li>
      <li>1 cup frozen corn kernels</li>
      <li>2 cups whole-grain elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
      <li>1 cup (about 4 oz.) shredded cheddar (or cheese of choice)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Cook both in a large pot with olive
        oil over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or until soft and transparent. Add
        the ground beef and continue to stir and cook until it is fully browned.
        If using a high fat ground beef, drain off the excessive after it is
        browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the flour and chili powder to the pot and stir to coat the meat.
        Continue to stir and cook the coated meat for 1-2 minutes more. The
        flour and chili powder may coat the bottom of the pot, but that's okay.
        Just be careful to not let it burn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain and rinse the black and kidney beans. Add the beans, tomato sauce,
        diced tomato, and corn kernels to the pot. Stir well and dissolve the
        flour/chili powder mixture from the bottom of the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the dry macaroni and two cups of beef broth to the pot and stir to
        combine. Place a lid on top, turn the heat up to high, and let the pot
        come to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, give it a quick stir to loosen
        any pasta stuck to the bottom of the pot, replace the lid, and turn the
        heat down to medium-low. Let the pot simmer on medium-low for about 15
        minutes, or until the pasta is soft and has absorbed most of the liquid.
        Stir the pot one or two times during the 15 minutes to loosen any pasta
        stuck to the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the pasta is fully cooked, turn the heat off and add the cheese.
        Stir the cheese into the pasta until it has melted in and become
        slightly creamy. Serve hot.
