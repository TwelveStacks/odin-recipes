      Protein pancakes are a great breakfast for any meal plan, and when you’re
      bulking, you can add all your favorite toppings. But that’s not the only
      way to start the day. Eggs are a healthy ingredient for building muscle,
      and with an omelette, you can fold in nutritious additions like ham,
      veggies, and cheese. For even more protein, enjoy it with turkey bacon or
      sausage links on the side.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>8 large eggs</li>
      <li>4 oz. diced ham</li>
      <li>2 bell peppers, diced</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
      <li>3 cups frozen shredded hash browns</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (about 4 oz.) grated smoked gouda</li>
      <li>1 bunch scallions, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Beat the eggs in a large bowl until foamy. Heat the olive oil in a large
        nonstick ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ham, bell
        peppers, onion, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cook,
        stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and starting to
        brown, about 6 minutes; add to the bowl with the eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the broiler. Wipe out the skillet and return to medium-high
        heat. Melt the butter in the skillet, then add the frozen hash browns in
        an even layer. Cook, pressing the hash browns into the bottom and up the
        side of the skillet with a spatula, until golden on the bottom, about 6
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the egg mixture over the hash browns. Transfer the skillet to the
        broiler; cook until partially set, 3 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle the cheese
        and all but about 2 tablespoons scallions over the eggs. Continue
        broiling until the cheese melts and the eggs are set, 2 to 3 more
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Loosen the edge of the omelet with a small spatula. Slide onto a platter
        and fold in half. Cut into wedges; top with the reserved scallions.
      </li>
