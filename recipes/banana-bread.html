    <p>Prep Time: 15 mins Cook Time: 1 hrs Total Time: 1 hrs 15 mins</p>
    <p>Servings: 12 Yield 1 9x5-inch loaf</p>

    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
      <li>
        Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the
        banana bread rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the
        loaf taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Butter: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible
        flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brown sugar: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eggs: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter
        together.
      </li>
      <li>Bananas: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <h2>How to Make Banana Bread</h2>
    <p>
      You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief
      overview of what you can expect when you make this simple banana bread:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine the dry ingredients in one bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Beat the butter and sugar in another bowl. Add the eggs and mashed
        bananas.
      </li>
      <li>Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter into a loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How to Make Banana Bread Moist</h2>
    <p>
      This banana bread is super moist thanks to butter, eggs, and brown sugar
      (which adds more moisture than white sugar). Plus, mashed bananas have
      plenty of moisture on their own. Make sure you store the banana bread
      properly to keep it moist for several days.
    </p>

    <h2>How Long to Bake Banana Bread</h2>
    <p>
      This banana bread recipe should be perfectly baked after about an hour in
      an oven preheated to 350 degrees F. You'll know it's done when a toothpick
      inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Make sure you let
      the bread sit in the pan for about 10 minutes before turning it out.
      Otherwise, it might not stay in one piece.
