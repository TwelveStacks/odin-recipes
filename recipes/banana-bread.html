    <p>Prep Time: 15 mins Cook Time: 1 hrs Total Time: 1 hrs 15 mins</p>
    <p>Servings: 12 Yield 1 9x5-inch loaf</p>

    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
      <li>
        Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the
        banana bread rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the
        loaf taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Butter: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible
        flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brown sugar: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Eggs: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter
        together.
      </li>
      <li>Bananas: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
    </ul>
